We can use an Email Header Parser Tool or configure a text editor to highlight and spot the email header's details easily.

-> You can use Sublime Text to view email files without opening and executing any of the linked attachments/commands. You can view the email
   file in the text editor using two approaches.
        - Right-click on the sample and open it with Sublime Text.
        - Open Sublime Text and drag & drop the sample into the text editor.

If your file has a ".eml" or ".msg" extension, the sublime text will automatically detect the structure and highlight the header fields for 
ease of readability. Note that if you are using a ".txt" or any other extension, you will need manually select the highlighting format by using
the button located at the lower right corner.


'Text editors are helpful in analysis, but there are some tools that can help you to view the email details in a clearer format.'

1. emlAnalyzer tool - to view the body of the email and analyse the attachments.
		    - The tool can show the headers, body, embedded URLs, plaintext and HTML data, and attachments.

Usage Query :

QUERY DETAILS						EXPLANATION

emlAnalyzer						Main Command
-i 							File to analyse
							-i /path-to-file/filename
--header						Show header
-u							Show URLs
--text							Show clear text data
--extract-all						Extract all attachments


Sample COMMAND : 
	
	emlAnalyzer -i /filename.eml --header --html -u --text --extract-all


At this point, you should have completed the following checks.
	- Sender and recipient controls
	- Return path control
	- Email server control
	- Message-ID control
	- Spam value control 
	- Attachment control (Does the email contains any attachment?)

-> Additionally, you can use some Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) tools to check email reputation and enrich the findings
-> Tool : https://emailrep.io/
	Here, if you find any suspicious URLs and IP addresses, consider using some OSINT tools for further investigation.


Further Investigation Tools

TOOL							PURPOSE

ViruTotal						A service that provides a cloud-based detection toolset and sandbox environment.
InQuest							A service provides network and file analysis by using threat analytics.
IPinfo.io						A service that provides detailed information about an IP address by focusing on 
							  geolocation data and service provider.
Talos Reputation					An IP reputation check service is provided by Cisco Talos.
Urlscan.io						A service that analyses websites by simulating regular user behaviour.
Browserling						A browser sandbox is used to test suspicious/malicious links.
Wannabrowser						A browser sandbox is used to test suspicious/malicious links.


Further you can continue with body and attachment analysis. Let's focus on analysing the email body and attachments. The sample doesn't have 
URLs, only an attachment. You need to compute the value of the file to conduct file-based reputation checks and further your analysis. 

	- You can use the sha256sum tool/utility to calculate the file's hash value. 
Note: Remember to navigate to the file's location before attempting to calculate the file's hash value.
	> sha256sum Division_of....

- Once you get the sum of the file, you can go for further analysis using the VirusTotal.
	Tool: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload

- Continue on reputation check on InQuest to enrich the gathered data.
	Tool: https://labs.inquest.net/

- Now visit the tool website and use the 'INDICATOR LOOKUP' option to conduct hash-based analysis.
	- Search the hash value
	- Click on the SHA256 hash value highlighted with yellow to view the detailed report.
	- Analyse the file details.





--> You are finished with the initial email analysis. The next steps are creating a report of findings and informing the team members/manager 
    in the appropriate format. <--
